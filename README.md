# Lightwork
Automated LED mapping application. Built using openFrameworks and OpenCV. This application detects physical LED locations using a webcam and saves the coordinates in an SVG file. The SVG can be loaded in the Processing counterpart, [Lightwork-Scraper](https://github.com/PWRFLcreative/Lightwork-Scraper).
